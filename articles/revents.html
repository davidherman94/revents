<strong>1. Recurrent events methods</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recurrent-events-methods"></a>
</h4>
<p>A variety of counts and survival statistical methods, called
recurrent events methods, have been developed for the correct estimation
of repeated events and to take into account events occurring after the
first event.</p>
<p>Recurrent events refer to the <em>repeated occurrence of the same
type of event over time for the same individual</em>, such as
hospitalizations, asthma attacks and multiple sclerosis relapses or
disability progressions. Although recurrent events can also consider
terminal events (i.e. death), in MS the likelihood of terminal events is
low and the interest of recurrent events methods rely on non-terminal
events.</p>
<p>Recurrent events are characterized with five main components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>time scale</strong> defined as calendar time (the time
measured from the time origin) or gap time (time is reset to zero after
each event);</p></li>
<li><p><strong>risk interval</strong> which defines when an individual
is at risk of having an event along a given timescale;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>risk set</strong> or the number of individuals who are at
risk at a given point in time</p></li>
<li><p><strong>event-specific or common baseline
hazard</strong></p></li>
<li><p>the way of handling the <strong>within-subject
correlation</strong>, which can be conditional, marginal or random
effects.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The risk interval is a key concept in recurrent events that allows to
define whether a model is either marginal or conditional. It can be
categorized as counting process, total time, and gap time (Figure
1).</p>
<p>The <em>counting process</em> uses calendar time as time scale but
considers also left truncation (i.e. delayed entry). For example,
individual B is at-risk for the first event between [0, 7) and for the
second, third and fourth event during [7, 11), [11, 16) and [16, 25),
respectively. An individual is not at-risk for a specific event before
previous event has been observed. <em>Total time</em> corresponds to the
time from time since the beginning of the observation in the study. For
instance, individual B is at-risk for the first event in the time
interval [0, 7), for the second event during [0, 11), for the third
event during [0, 16) and for the fourth event during [0, 25). On the
other hand, <em>gap time</em> is the time from the prior event. The
individual B is assumed to be at risk for the first event during [0, 7)
and for the second, third and fourth event during [0, 4), [0, 4) and [0,
9).</p>

<p>Another important concept in recurrent event methods is the type of
intervention effect measure obtained. Methods can be based on cumulative
events (number of events by end of study), event rate (number of events
per unit time), time to event (time to successive events) and gap time
(times between successive events are accounted). Event rate models yield
a rate ratio (RR) as estimation measure (i.e. Poisson and negative
binomial models), and models based on time-to-event (i.e. CoxPH) provide
a hazard ratio (HR) as measure of effect.</p>

<strong>2. Multiple Sclerosis and associated clinical
outcomes</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#multiple-sclerosis-and-associated-clinical-outcomes"></a>
</h4>
<p>Relapses and disability progression are the main outcomes to evaluate
disease progression in MS.</p>
<p>Disability progression is often measured by the changes in the
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), which ranges from 0 to 10, with
higher score indicating more severe disease. These changes are frequent
primary endpoints in clinical trials and can be derived by measuring
confirmed disability progressions (CDP) during follow-up. Relapses, are
mainly measured by the Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) in RRMS clinical
trials.</p>
